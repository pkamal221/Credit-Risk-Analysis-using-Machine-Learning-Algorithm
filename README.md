# Credit-Risk-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm

In this project , I am trying to do solve below questions : 

### I am using German Credit Risk dataset .The dataset will be used to predict if Loan sanctioned to an individual will be a good risk or bad risk.
### Can I use this dataset to build Statistics models to predict the loan Risk and compare the accuracy of the models to check which model has the highest accuracy.
### If Yes, then how can I reduce the model and check if prediction accuracy improved or not?
